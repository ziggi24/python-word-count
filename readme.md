# Python Word Count
## By Zach Sharpe

This is a small project that I put together for a Idiolect project for BIS317,
Language and Cultural Knowledge. We are supposed to analyze our speech patterns
and pick out common word choices, patterns and distinctions between professional
and personal writing. I thought this would be a perfect candidate for a python
project. And here we are!

This small script will take in an input file (included input.txt for my writing
samples), parse through the entirety of the text, and return the 100 most used
words, and the number of times they were used in the sample.

### Version 0.1

__Added__
